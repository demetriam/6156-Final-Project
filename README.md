RQ1.1
Our code for RQ1.1 is built on https://github.com/ColumbiaCEAL/spatial-interactions-extension and can be found at https://github.com/avd2131/coms6156_final_project. It is in a seperate repo because it required forking off of the spatial interactions extension project. We recorded a demo, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTPocgtyr7g. The Chrome Extension can be run locally with the instructions given in the README of the linked project.

RQ1.2
Our code for RQ1.2 can be found under /altai. The screenshots that we processed can be found under /screenshots. To reproduce our experiment run /altai/main.py.

RQ2
Our code for RQ2 can be found under /speech_processing_pt2. We recorded a demo, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc73DenpiL4. To run the system run /speech_processing_pt2/capture_speech.py.
